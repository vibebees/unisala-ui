Then, suddenly i was rerouted to Counter Y (At this point, i was pretty stressed but i took a deep breath and continued moving forward)\nHere is how my VISA interview went.\n\nMe: Namaste Vo. How are you?\nI slid my documents (i20, passport, sevis fee confirmation and my masters transcript) under the glass pane. ( Don't worry you will be taught what documents to have in hand, so that you can give it to the Vo when your turn comes)\nVO : Namaste. Which university?\nMe: Ah!

He started looking at his computer to the right (At this moment, i felt as if he was annoyed but i was smiling)\nMe: Oh! I am sorry sir. Please take your time.\nAfter 5 seconds, he asked something but i didn't hear it. So, i told him. I am sorry sir. Can you please repeat the question?\nVO: Why Delaware?\nMe: Actually, it is connected to my prospective research. My research aspirations and prof. Xxx's work is in close proximity and i strongly feel this lab, this university will be a perfect place for me to learn................. (Interrupted)\nVO:Wife?\nMe: Yes, i have a wife.\nVO: Any children?\nMe: No, Vo. Not till now. (At this point, he was smiling)\nVO: You got plans?\nMe: Yes, Vo. I plan to return and continue my present job.................\nEven before, i had completed my answer he had returned my documents and i was like what's happening? But, i saw that there was a green slip below those documents. I heard him say \"i am keeping your passport\". And my interview was over.\nIt was less than 30-40 seconds.\nI was asking myself \"This is it? Is it really over? I mean this fast.\nTips:\n1) To me, its all about handling the pressure at that moment. You will see interviews happening before your eyes. You will see rejections, acceptance and even know what type of questions VO are asking to others. At this moment, stick to your original answers and don't improvise. You should console yourself, stay super calm and always wear a smile, even if it's fake.\n2) Be prepared to face questions about your downside. For instance, if you don't have any scholarship or you don't have good grades or you have an immediate family member in US or the course you are choosing can also be taken here in Nepal.\nAnalyze your situation and point out your own downside. Prepare answers related to them. While answering these questions, sound robust, talk in a relatively higher tone (but don't shout) so that they feel convinced with you.\n3) Don't just ride your luck. Prepare well. Stand firm in front of the Vo as if you have a strong motivation for this. He might not look at you, keep typing, leave you waiting for some seconds or even minutes. Keep your cool and keep answering.\n4) I had seen those Vos take 2-3 minutes or even more with some students. Every VISA interview is different. I was also expecting a long VISA interview but mine was short. Be fully prepared from your side.\nI hope this will be of much help for newbies taking their interviews in the coming days.\nCheers!\n\n\n"

I arrived at the gate at 9 am which was unnecessarily early. Got inside the\ngates of the embassy at around 9:30 since everyone who had an appointment at\n9:45 had already gone in.\nWent inside and they didn't have my name on the list but the guard told me not\nto worry about it since I had the appointment confirmation so it didn't matter\nmuch which was a huge relief to hear since I was already stressed\nenough(Thanks guard dai). After I went through the checking I sat at the waiting\nspot for around 15 minutes and went to stall number 2 right at 10 o\u2019clock.\nGot in line to see one of the visa Vos\u2026..this moment was the scariest in\nparticular because students who were speaking with so much confidence were\nalso getting the yellow slip the guy in front of me at the line and me were just\nsweating at this point lol.Finally my turn came and I saw in front of me a 6 foot\ntall giant with a bald head and quite an impressive beard.)\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what I said as I was extremely nervous but I will try to\nsay what I remember!!\nMe: Good morning sir (*trying to show all the happiness i have experienced in\nthis one smile*)\nVO: Namaste and good morning to you. Your documents please?\nMe: Here you go\u2026.(*his arms are sweaty knees weak arm are heavy* lol)\nVO: So why University of Louisiana at Monroe?\nMe: The scholarship provided to me by ULM seemed much more beneficial to\nme in comparison to other universities that I applied to. I have gotten a\nscholarship of around 75% in my academics and i have also gotten a housing\nwaiver for me stay within the college. I have also been invited into the honors\nprogram so I will have the benefit of studying in a small class size and more\nengaging coursework.\nVO: Why computer science?(*continues typing without even looking at me*)\nMe: I have been involved in computer science since my high school and\ncompleted my professional web development training here in Nepal. And\nthrough all this time my interest in this field has grown exponentially and I think\nI can have a great and fun career in this field.(said this although i was so thrown\noff by him not even paying any attention to me\u2026)\nVo:Who will be financially supporting you?\nMy parents will be the ones sponsoring me. My father is a well renowned and\nrespected lawyer. He currently works for 2 major companies as their legal\nadvisor namely x and y. He has an annual income of around $XXXXX. While my\nsweet mother is a worker in a cooperative and has an annual income of around\n$XXXXX\nVO: What will you do after graduation?\nMe: Being the single child of my parents I have a great responsibility of taking\ncare of them here. So after I return back to Nepal I intend to start working at\nsome renowned developer companies like Leapfrog, Cotiviti or any\norganizations that stand at the top of the developer game in Nepal. But as a\nlong term plan I intend to open a data analysis consultancy with the financial\nsupport of my father.\nVO: (*types for a solid minute without saying a word*)\nMe:(*thinks gore nai chup chap hune answer diye ki k ho?*)\n(The lights go off and i don't know what the VO was thinking but maybe he\ndecided to mess with me at this point)\nVO: Oh! The lights went out looks like a bad sign for you\u2026.(*finally smiles*)\nMe: (*smiles awkwardly although my heart races at 320 kmph*)\n(lights come back)\nVO: please put your left hand at the scanner\nMe:(*does the biometrics*)\nVo: Ok then Unnayan(mispronounces my name thrice which i didn't bother to\ncorrect) what does your name mean?\nMe: Progress in sanskrit (*finally having a smiley chat with the vo made me a bit\nconfident*)\nVO: Alright! Hope you PROGRESS a lot in the united states of america. Welcome\nMe: thank you so much sir and have a great day.\n\n\n"

I don\u2019t know why but while answering the first few questions I\ngot really scared and wasn\u2019t able to speak properly. I will write everything that I\nremember but I might have missed things as i got scared.)\nMe: Good morning Vo\nVO: Good morning. How\u2019s your day going?\nMe: It is good. What about yours? ( VO didn\u2019t answer)\nVO: Pass me your I-20 and Passport\nMe: Passed the documents along with my highschool marksheets\nVO: What has changed from your first time?\n( I got really confused as this was my first interview)\nMe: This is my first interview, Vo.\nVO: Oh okay. (Started typing something)\nVO: Why did you choose the USA?\nMe: USA has been the best place for IT for the past decades so as a student who\nis going to study in the IT field USA is the best destination for me. ( I took a long\nbreath because I wasn't able to speak properly then I continued ) The course in\nthe USA is also more practical and research based as compared to Nepal and\nyou know that how much practical knowledge is important for students in the IT\nField. Furthermore, I believe it was in grade 3 that i found out you could go to\npursue your higher education in the USA, it has been my dream ever since to go\nthere and study as the exposure i will be getting will be good.\n(I was very nervous at the beginning so i was taking breaks in middle of my\nanswer, the VO didn\u2019t interrupt and listened to my full answer)\nVO: What do you think are the challenges that you will be facing in the USA?\nMe: I have heard that the crime rate is a bit higher in Monroe so that might be\none of the challenges. ( The VO seemed like she didn\u2019t like this answer so i\nadded a bit) According to my research there are very few things to do for\nEntertainment in Monroe so that is also difficult. But I don't think there will be\nany challenges because I will be staying in the college and studying so these\nwon\u2019t affect me that much.\nVO: So you have about $10000 to pay. Who is going to fund you?\nMe: My maternal uncle and aunt are going to be my sponsors. I am very close to\nthem as we used to stay together when they were in Nepal. They are currently\nin Australia working in the health field. They work at Royal Darwin Hospital and\nmy aunt is working as a Nurse in the N2 position.\n( I took a break to breathe but the VO asked another question.)\nVO: Where are your parents? ( Not exactly sure if it was this question but it was\nsomething regarding my parents.)\nMe: They are currently in Japan. My father is in the restaurant business and\nearns about $XXXX and my mom is working in the food packaging industry as a\nsupervisor and earns about $XXXX.\nThey are also equally capable of sponsoring me but my uncle and aunt stepped\nup to sponsor so they are going to sponsor me.\nVO: So your aunt is a nurse.\n( I found this as an opportunity to add more to my answer)\nMe: Yes and my uncle is also a physician RDO working at the same place. My\naunt earns about $XXXX and uncle earns about $XXXX per annum. They also\nhave savings of about $XXXX which they will use towards my education.\nVO: What are your plans after graduation?\nMe: I will be returning to Nepal after my graduation. I will work as a software\ndeveloper in companies like Cotivitiy, Leapfrog and Cloudfactory. I will be able\nto secure a high paying job in Nepal with my US degree so I will return back to\nNepal.\n\n\n\n"

Never go with consultancy because they really don't care about your visa, I have known several people who have been in trouble due to consultancy.  Always Go with self apply, If you got any  doubts or concerns there are tons of facebook pages and telegram groups for F1 students were you can ask freely. By applying self, you'll learn more about the universities, programs, etc so you don't have to prepare much for interview.\n2. Always prepare your own answers for the interview. If you prepare by yourself, you won't lose confidence and won't need to practice as much. I only took a total of 7-8 hours of mock interviews with friends but I was still confident in my answers.\n\n"

But still I managed to show myself as a calm and confident person to VO.)\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what I said as I was extremely nervous but I will try to say what I remember!!\nMe: Good afternoon Vo (with a big smile on my face)\nVO: Good afternoon. university of lousia\u2026(He was not able to pronounce the name so he stooped for a moment) Why this university?\nMe: After researching some of the Universities I found out that this university has a really good course on cybersecurity which is also my topic of interest and I also contacted a professor named Dr. Jose Cordova who said that they are currently having a research on cybersecurity. Also they have provided me with a decent amount of scholarship which makes this university really affordable for my parents. On top of that they have also included me in a highly selective program called honors program which provides me with the opportunity to work alongside the professors in their research projects.\nVO: I saw his facial expressions changing and he gave a subtle smile and interrupted me with another question.\nMe: ( I became more confident and then gave my answer with perfect voice modulations and hand gestures.)\nVO: Why this major?\nMe: since my early childhood I was really interested into the computers and I want to further improve my knowledge on this field. On top of that almost every sector in Nepal has just started to get digitalized there are some security risks associated with this. However there are not enough expertise in this field to solve the issue. So I\u2026(Again interrupted)\nVo: (he was smiling at that time also and I thought that he was impressed by my answers) Who you are going to sponsor you?\nMy parents are going to be my sponsors my father owns xyz and my mom helps her in his business. They earn around $..... annually.\nVO: What will you do after graduation?\nMe: after graduation I see myself working in some of the renowned companies of Nepal like f1 soft and Bhairav Tech.(He was smiling). And after gaining some experience..\n(He turned back and moved his hands towards yellow slip then I stopped but he turned his head, smiled and moved his hands again but towards the green slip and gave me.)\nI was able to understand what was going on.\nVO: welcome to United states!!\nMe: Thank you so much sir.\nVO then gave me a big bright smile.\nOnly thing that I noticed about this VO was his bald scalp, beard and his smile.\nThen I went outside the hall and checked every documents. Then I returned to take my passport back. But Pale dai laughed at me and said, \u201cVisa lagepaxi manxe haru estai hunxan. Passport utai chodne ho ni vai\u201d. Then I realized.\ud83e\udd26\nMy suggestion to every one: Don\u2019t show them that you are nervous. Wear any outfits but don\u2019t forget that confidence is the best outfit!\nIf anybody needs my help feel free to contact\n\n\n\n"

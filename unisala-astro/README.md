# Astro-React-Radix-Tailwind Starter
This repository serves as a lightweight starter template for building projects using Astro, React, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS.

Originally inspired by the work in the [astro-nomy](https://github.com/mickasmt/astro-nomy) repository, this template is designed to provide a solid foundation for developers looking to explore how Astro can work with React and Tailwind CSS, enhanced with the accessibility-ready components from Radix UI.


## Features

- **Astro**: Modern build optimizations with a focus on performance.
- **React**: Flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Radix UI**: Components for building high-quality design systems and web apps.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
